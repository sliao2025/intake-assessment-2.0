# Voice Recorder Complete Fix - Cloud Storage & SQL Sync

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **SQL Database Not Deleting Audio References**

**Problem**: When deleting a recording, the `onAttach(null)` was called but the audio field in SQL was set to `undefined` instead of being completely removed, causing the field to persist on reload.

**Solution**: Modified the `StorySection.tsx` to properly construct the updated profile object:

```typescript
const updatedProfile = {
  ...profile,
  storyNarrative: {
    text: profile.storyNarrative?.text || "",
    ...(data && {
      audio: {
        url: data.url,
        fileName: data.fileName,
        uploadedAt: data.uploadedAt,
      },
    }),
    // When data is null, audio field is NOT included (truly deleted)
  },
};
```

**Key Change**: Using spread operator with conditional logic `...(data && { audio: {...} })` ensures the audio field is completely omitted when `data` is null, rather than being set to `undefined`.

### 2. **Blob URL Memory Leaks**

**Problem**: When recordings were deleted, the blob URLs created with `URL.createObjectURL()` were never revoked, causing:

- Memory leaks
- Deleted recordings still being playable from cached blob URLs
- Audio persisting even after cloud storage deletion

**Solution**: Implemented proper blob URL lifecycle management:

```typescript
// Track blob URL with ref for cleanup
const audioURLRef = useRef<string | null>(audioState ?? null);

const reset = () => {
  // Revoke blob URL to free memory
  const currentURL = audioURLRef.current;
  if (currentURL && currentURL.startsWith("blob:")) {
    console.log(`[useRecorder] Revoking blob URL: ${currentURL}`);
    URL.revokeObjectURL(currentURL);
  }

  setAudioURL(null);
  setAudioBlob(null);
  audioURLRef.current = null;
};

// Cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    const currentURL = audioURLRef.current;
    if (currentURL && currentURL.startsWith("blob:")) {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(currentURL);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

### 3. **Atomic Operations for Cloud & SQL Sync**

**Problem**: Upload and delete operations were not properly coordinated between cloud storage and SQL database.

**Solution**: Implemented strict sequential operations:

#### Upload Flow:

```
1. Stop Recording → Blob Created
2. Auto-upload triggered (useEffect)
3. Upload to Cloud Storage (overwrites if exists)
4. Call onAttach(uploadData)
   ├─ Construct updated profile with audio data
   ├─ Save to SQL database via PUT /api/profile/create
   └─ Update parent local state
5. Update VoiceRecorder local state (isUploaded=true)
```

#### Delete Flow:

```
1. User clicks DELETE
2. Delete from Cloud Storage (DELETE /api/upload/audio)
3. Call onAttach(null)
   ├─ Construct updated profile WITHOUT audio field
   ├─ Save to SQL database via PUT /api/profile/create
   └─ Update parent local state
4. Clear VoiceRecorder local state
5. Revoke blob URL
```

#### Re-record Flow:

```
1. User clicks RECORD (when recording exists)
2. Call handleDelete()
   ├─ Delete from Cloud Storage
   ├─ Clear SQL database
   └─ Clear all local state
3. Start new recording
```

## Technical Details

### Cloud Storage Design

- Filename format: `${userId}/${fieldName}.webm` (no timestamp)
- Only ONE file per field per user
- New uploads automatically overwrite old files
- Prevents orphaned files

### SQL Database Design

- Profile stored as JSON in `Profile.json` column
- Audio field structure:

```typescript
{
  storyNarrative: {
    text?: string;
    audio?: {
      url: string;        // Proxy URL through API
      fileName: string;   // Cloud storage path
      uploadedAt: string; // ISO timestamp
    }
  }
}
```

- When deleting: audio field is completely omitted (not set to undefined)
- `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(profile))` removes undefined values before saving

### Blob URL Management

- Blob URLs created with `URL.createObjectURL()` for local playback
- Must be revoked with `URL.revokeObjectURL()` to free memory
- Tracked via `audioURLRef` for reliable cleanup
- Revoked on:
  - Delete operation
  - Reset operation
  - Component unmount
  - Before creating new recording

## State Flow

### Recording Stop:

```
MediaRecorder.stop()
  → Blob created in mr.onstop
  → audioBlob state updated
  → useEffect detects new blob
  → uploadBlobToCloud()
    → Upload to GCS
    → onAttach(data)
      → Save to SQL
      → Update parent state
    → Update local state
```

### Delete:

```
User clicks DELETE
  → handleDelete()
    → DELETE /api/upload/audio
    → onAttach(null)
      → Save to SQL (audio field omitted)
      → Update parent state
    → reset()
      → Revoke blob URL
      → Clear local state
```

### Load on Page Refresh:

```
Component mounts
  → Load profile from SQL
  → audio?.url extracted
  → Passed to VoiceRecorder as audioState prop
  → If exists, show playback UI
  → Audio streamed through /api/upload/audio/stream
```

## Key Code Changes

### StorySection.tsx

```typescript
// OLD (BROKEN) - audio: undefined persists in JSON
audio: data ? { url: data.url, ... } : undefined

// NEW (FIXED) - audio field completely omitted when null
...(data && { audio: { url: data.url, ... } })
```

### VoiceRecorder.tsx

```typescript
// Added blob URL tracking and cleanup
const audioURLRef = useRef<string | null>(audioState ?? null);

// Revoke on reset
const reset = () => {
  const currentURL = audioURLRef.current;
  if (currentURL && currentURL.startsWith("blob:")) {
    URL.revokeObjectURL(currentURL);
  }
  // ... clear state
};

// Revoke on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (audioURLRef.current?.startsWith("blob:")) {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(audioURLRef.current);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] **New Recording**: Record → Stop → Verify in cloud & SQL
- [x] **Auto-upload**: Recording stops, upload happens automatically
- [x] **Delete**: Delete → Verify removed from cloud & SQL
- [x] **Re-record**: Record → Delete → Record → Only one file exists
- [x] **Navigation**: Record → Navigate away → Back → Recording shown
- [x] **Reload**: Record → Reload page → Recording loaded from SQL
- [x] **Playback**: Play deleted recording → Should not play
- [x] **Memory**: Delete → Blob URL revoked → No memory leak
- [x] **SQL Persistence**: Delete → Reload → No audio field in profile

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Deleted recording still plays"

**Cause**: Blob URL not revoked, cached in memory
**Fix**: Blob URL now properly revoked in `reset()` and on unmount

### Issue: "Recording appears after reload even though deleted"

**Cause**: SQL database still has audio field with `undefined` value
**Fix**: Audio field now completely omitted from profile object when deleting

### Issue: "Multiple files in cloud storage for same field"

**Cause**: Timestamp-based filenames creating new files
**Fix**: Filename format changed to `userId/fieldName.webm` (no timestamp), automatically overwrites

### Issue: "Upload happens multiple times"

**Cause**: useEffect triggers multiple times
**Fix**: Added `uploadingRef` guard to prevent duplicate uploads
